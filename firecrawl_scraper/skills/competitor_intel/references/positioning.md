# Positioning Analysis Framework

## The Positioning Statement Formula

```
For [target customer]
who [has this need/problem],
[Our Brand] is a [category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [competitor],
we [key differentiator].
```

### Example:
```
For Pittsburgh-area businesses
who need to showcase their spaces online,
Psybir is a virtual tour agency
that delivers immersive 360° experiences with local expertise.
Unlike national providers,
we combine cutting-edge technology with hands-on local service.
```

## Competitor Positioning Map

### Axis Options

**Common X-axis dimensions:**
- Price (Low → High)
- Service scope (Narrow → Broad)
- Market focus (Local → National)
- Speed (Fast → Thorough)

**Common Y-axis dimensions:**
- Quality/Premium (Budget → Luxury)
- Technology (Traditional → Innovative)
- Service model (DIY → Full-service)
- Specialization (Generalist → Specialist)

                       |
    Boutique Expert    |    Premium Full-Service
    (High quality,     |    (High quality,
     narrow focus)     |     broad service)
                       |
 NARROW ---------------|--------------- BROAD
                       |
    Budget Specialist  |    Value Provider
    (Affordable,       |    (Affordable,
     focused service)  |     wide offering)
                       |
                    BUDGET
```

## Messaging Theme Analysis

### Categories of Positioning Claims

| Theme | Competitor Claims | Our Response |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Quality** | "Best in class", "Premium" | Match or differentiate |
| **Price** | "Affordable", "Best value" | Don't compete or own value |
| **Speed** | "Fast turnaround", "Same day" | Match if possible |
| **Local** | "Local experts", "Community" | Critical to own this |
| **Technology** | "Cutting edge", "Latest tech" | Demonstrate, don't just claim |
| **Experience** | "20 years", "Industry veterans" | Counter with innovation |
| **Results** | "Proven ROI", "Guaranteed" | Use case studies |

### Message Testing Framework

Rate competitor messaging (1-5):

1. **Clarity**: Is the message immediately understood?
2. **Relevance**: Does it address customer needs?
3. **Differentiation**: Does it stand out from competitors?
4. **Credibility**: Is it believable/provable?
5. **Memorability**: Will customers remember it?

## Value Proposition Canvas

### For Each Competitor, Map:

**Customer Jobs** (what they're trying to do)
- Functional jobs
- Social jobs
- Emotional jobs

**Pains** (what frustrates them)
- Undesired outcomes
- Obstacles
- Risks

**Gains** (what they want to achieve)
- Required outcomes
- Expected outcomes
- Desired outcomes
- Unexpected outcomes

**Then analyze competitor's:**

**Products/Services** → Which jobs do they address?

**Pain Relievers** → Which pains do they solve?

**Gain Creators** → Which gains do they enable?

## Competitive Positioning Gaps

### Finding Whitespace

1. **Unserved segments**: Who are competitors ignoring?
2. **Underserved needs**: What jobs aren't being done well?
3. **Emerging demands**: What new needs are appearing?
4. **Geographic gaps**: What areas aren't covered?
5. **Price points**: What price tiers are missing?

### Gap Documentation Template

```yaml
gap_identified: "[Description of the gap]"
evidence: "[How we know this gap exists]"
opportunity_size: "[small | medium | large]"
our_ability_to_fill: "[strong | moderate | weak]"
competitor_response_risk: "[high | medium | low]"
priority_score: "[1-10]"
recommended_action: "[Specific next step]"
```

## Perceptual Mapping Exercise

### Data Collection

For each competitor + yourself, score on key dimensions:

| Attribute | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C | Us |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Price perception (1-10) | 7 | 4 | 8 | 6 |
| Quality perception (1-10) | 8 | 5 | 9 | 7 |
| Local presence (1-10) | 6 | 9 | 3 | 8 |
| Innovation (1-10) | 7 | 4 | 8 | 9 |
| Service breadth (1-10) | 8 | 6 | 9 | 5 |

### Strategic Implications

1. **Where are we similar?** → Risk of substitution
2. **Where are we different?** → Differentiation opportunity
3. **Where is whitespace?** → Uncontested positioning
4. **Where is overcrowding?** → Avoid or dominate

## Decision Output

After positioning analysis, answer:

1. **What positioning should we own?**
   - Primary: [Your main positioning]
   - Supporting: [Secondary claims]

2. **What should we NOT compete on?**
   - [Dimension]: [Reason to avoid]

3. **What messaging changes are needed?**
   - Website: [Changes]
   - Sales pitch: [Changes]
   - Marketing: [Changes]
